# Common Issues

## "My mobs' health cap at 2048!"

If you set your mob's health to a number higher than 2048 and see that it is capped at 2048, it is likely an issue with your `spigot.yml` configuration file.
In that file, there is a config option under `settings` called `attribute` that looks like this by default:

```yml
  attribute:
    maxHealth:
      max: 2048.0
    movementSpeed:
      max: 2048.0
    attackDamage:
      max: 2048.0
```

This is the maximum value that any attribute can have. If you want to increase the maximum health of your mobs, you will need to increase the `maxHealth` value.
