# Your First Skill

If you followed the previous page, you should have a mob that can move around and attack, but it's still pretty boring - it doesn't have _custom_ abilities.
Mythic provides us with a powerful tool to create custom abilities for our mobs: **skills**.
Skills are the bread and butter of MythicMobs, and are what makes MythicMobs so powerful and distinct from other mob plugins.

## How skills work

Skills are the actions that mobs can perform. They can be used to do a variety of things, such as spawning other mobs, shooting projectiles, or even just playing a sound.
Let's add a skill to our mob that will make it play some ambient particles on itself. The skill looks like this:

```yaml
effect:particles{p=flame;hS=0.25;vS=0.5;amount=10} @selfLocation{yoffset=1} ~onTimer:5
```

Don't worry if it looks intimidating - we'll go over what each part of this skill does.

### The Mechanic

The first part of the skill is `effect:particles{p=flame;hS=0.25;vS=0.5;amount=10}`.
This is the _Mechanic_ of the skill. It's what the skill actually does. In this case, it's showing some particles.
The things inside the `{}` are called _fields_, and they are used to configure the Mechanic.

- `p=flame` - This is the particle type. In this case, it's a flame particle.
- `hS=0.25` - This is the horizontal spread of the particles.
- `vS=0.5` - This is the vertical spread of the particles.
- `amount=10` - This is the number of particles to show.

With these fields, we can configure the particles to our liking.

### The Targeter

The next part of the skill is `@selfLocation{yoffset=1}`.
Looking at the `@` in the beginning, this is the _Targeter_ of the skill. It's what the skill will be performed on. In this case, it's the mob's location.
Once again, we have fields inside the `{}`. These fields are used to configure the Targeter.
In this case, we're using the `yoffset` field to offset the Targeter's location by 1 block in the y direction.

### The Trigger

The last part of the skill is `~onTimer:5`.
This is the _Trigger_ of the skill. It's what causes the skill to be performed. In this case, it's a timer Trigger - the skill will fire on a set interval.
You can tell it's a Trigger because it starts with a `~`.
The `5` is the interval of the timer, in ticks. There are 20 ticks in a second, so this skill will fire every 0.25 seconds.

## Adding it to the mob

Now that we have our skill, we need to add it on the mob so that it knows to actually use the skill.
We do this by adding it to the mob's `Skills` list.

```yaml
DemonicMage:
  Type: SKELETON
  Display: "&4☠ &7Demonic Mage &4☠"
  Health: 100
  Damage: 10
  Options:
    MovementSpeed: 0.3
    PreventOtherDrops: true
    PreventSunburn: true
    KnockbackResistance: 1
  Equipment:
  - BLAZE_ROD HAND
  - LEATHER_HELMET HEAD
  - LEATHER_CHESTPLATE CHEST
  - LEATHER_LEGGINGS LEGS
  - LEATHER_BOOTS FEET
  # highlight-start
  Skills:
  - effect:particles{p=flame;hS=0.25;vS=0.5;amount=10} @selfLocation{yoffset=1} ~onTimer:5
  # highlight-end
```

Now, reload MythicMobs and spawn the mob. You should see some particles coming from the mob.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've just created your first skill. Skills are an important part of MythicMobs, and you'll be using them a lot.
In the next page, we'll create a much more complex skill, so below is a quick quiz to make sure you understand the basics of skills.
