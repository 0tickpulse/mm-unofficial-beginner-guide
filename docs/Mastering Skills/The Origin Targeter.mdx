# The Origin Targeter

Arguably the most complex Mythic targeter, `@Origin` is a targeter that works differently based on the context it is used in.

## In a [Projectile](./The%20Projectile)

When used in a skill run by a projectile, `@Origin` will target the projectile's location. For instance,

```yml
Fireball:
  Skills:
  - projectile{oT=FireballTick;oH=FireballHit} @Target
FireballTick:
  Skills:
  - effect:particles{p=flame} @Origin
FireballHit:
  Skills:
  - damage{a=12}
```

Looking at the `FireballTick` skill, you can see that the particles have an `@Origin` targeter.
This means that the particles will be spawned at the projectile's location.

## With the `origin` Field

<PremiumOnly />

When used in a skill with the `origin` field, `@Origin` will target the location specified in the field. For instance,

```yml
SomeSkill:
  Skills:
  - effect:particles{p=flame;origin=@Forward{f=3}} @Origin
```

The particles have an `@Origin` targeter but also have an `origin` field. This means that the particles will be spawned at `@Forward{f=3}`.

This doesn't seem useful right now, but it has a few use cases especially when used with other targeters. For example:

```yml
SomeSkill:
  Skills:
  - effect:particles{p=flame;origin=@Forward{f=3}} @EntitiesNearOrigin{r=3}
```

This skill will spawn particles at `@Forward{f=3}`, but will only target entities near that location.

Another use case is with the `fromOrigin` field, which allows you to make a mechanic start at the origin. For example:

```yml
MyProj:
  Skills:
  - projectile{fromOrigin=true;origin=@SelfLocation{yOffset=5}} @Target
```

Now, instead of starting at the caster's location, the projectile will start 5 blocks above the caster's location.
