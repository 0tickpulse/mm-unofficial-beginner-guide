# Factions and AI

The first concept we will learn with the new Royal Guard is the concept of factions.
In short, factions are a way to group mobs together.

To assign a faction to a mob, we will use the `Faction` field in the mob's configuration:

```yml title="/plugins/MythicMobs/Mobs/RoyalGuard.yml"
RoyalGuard:
  Type: SKELETON
  Display: '&6⚔ &7Royal Guard &6⚔'
  Health: 100
  Damage: 10
  Options:
    MovementSpeed: 0.3
    PreventOtherDrops: true
    PreventSunburn: true
    KnockbackResistance: 1
  Equipment:
  - IRON_SWORD HAND
  - IRON_HELMET HEAD
  - IRON_CHESTPLATE CHEST
  - IRON_LEGGINGS LEGS
  - IRON_BOOTS FEET
  # highlight-start
  Faction: Royal
  # highlight-end
  KillMessages:
  - <target.name> was killed by a Royal Guard
```

Here, we have assigned the `Royal` faction to our Royal Guard mob.
Next, we will go back to our Demonic Mage and assign it the `Demon` faction:

```yml title="/plugins/MythicMobs/Mobs/DemonicMage.yml"
DemonicMage:
  Type: SKELETON
  Display: "&4☠ &7Demonic Mage &4☠"
  Health: 100
  Damage: 10
  Options:
    MovementSpeed: 0.3
    PreventOtherDrops: true
    PreventSunburn: true
    KnockbackResistance: 1
  Equipment:
  - BLAZE_ROD HAND
  - LEATHER_HELMET HEAD
  - LEATHER_CHESTPLATE CHEST
  - LEATHER_LEGGINGS LEGS
  - LEATHER_BOOTS FEET
  # highlight-start
  Faction: Demon
  # highlight-end
  Skills:
  - effect:particles{p=flame;hS=0.25;vS=0.5;amount=10} @selfLocation{yoffset=1} ~onTimer:5
  - skill{skill=DemonicMageFireball} ~onTimer:20 0.5
  Drops:
  - DemonicMageDrops
```

Currently, these factions are just names, but we will soon see how they can be used to create more interesting interactions between mobs.
This is mainly done through the use of custom AI in our mobs.
