# The Projectile

Mythic has a useful mechanic called `projectile`. This allows full control over projectiles in skills, allowing you to create fireballs, beams, waves, and more!
However, this skill is extremely difficult to master and requires vast knowledge of Mythic's mechanics. This guide will teach you how to use the `projectile` mechanic.

## How projectiles work

Mythic projectiles are simple in concept: they are simply points in space that move.
By itself, the projectile does nothing, but the user can define behavior for the projectile when it spawns, when it ticks, when it hits something, and when it ends. For instance, a fireball projectile can play a particle effect when it ticks, and deal damage when it hits something.

The physics of the projectile is as follows:

- The projectile spawns.
- Then, it moves some distance forward.
  - This is called a `tick`. Every time the projectile moves, it ticks and runs the `onTick` skill field.
  - If it hits an entity, it runs the `onHit` skill field.

Confusing? Let's make a projectile.

## Creating a projectile

Let's begin with a simple `projectile` skill.

```yml title="/plugins/MythicMobs/Mobs/ProjectileCaster.yml"
ProjectileCaster:
  Type: ZOMBIE
  Health: 100
  Display: "I cast projectiles"
  Skills:
  - skill{skill=CoolProjectileSkill} ~onTimer:100
```

```yml title="/plugins/MythicMobs/Skills/CoolProjectileSkill.yml"
CoolProjectileSkill:
  Skills:
  - projectile @Target
```

This is the bare minimum - it fires a projectile at the mob's target. However, if you spawn the mob now, the projectile will do nothing. We will need to add things to the projectile.

## onStart, onTick, onHit, onEnd

Firstly, we will need to add a `onTick` skill attribute. This sets what meta-skill will be run every time the projectile ticks.

```yml
CoolProjectileSkill:
  Skills:
  - projectile{onTick=CoolProjectileSkillTick} @Target
CoolProjectileSkillTick:
  Skills:
  # Will do later
```

In this example, the projectile will run `CoolProjectileSkillTick` every time the projectile ticks. Usually, people put particle effects in the `onTick`.

```yml
CoolProjectileSkill:
  Skills:
  - projectile{onTick=CoolProjectileSkillTick} @Target
CoolProjectileSkillTick:
  Skills:
  # highlight-start
  - effect:particles{p=flame}
  # highlight-end
```

But... what targeter do we use? `@Self` will play the particles on the mob, `@Target` will play it on the mob's target, but we need the particle to play at the projectile's location...

Introducing the `@Origin` targeter. This is an incredibly complex targeter, so complex it requires a [whole separate guide page](./The%20Origin%20Targeter) on it. For now, just know that when this targeter is used in a meta-skill that is fired due to a projectile, it acts as a targeter that targets the projectile's location.

```yml
CoolProjectileSkill:
  Skills:
  - projectile{onTick=CoolProjectileSkillTick} @Target
# highlight-start
CoolProjectileSkillTick:
  Skills:
  - effect:particles{p=flame} @Origin
# highlight-end
```

Next, we add an `onHit` skill attribute, which denotes what meta-skill is run when the projectile hits something.

```yml
CoolProjectileSkill:
  Skills:
  # highlight-start
  - projectile{onTick=CoolProjectileSkillTick;onHit=CoolProjectileSkillHit} @Target
  # highlight-end
CoolProjectileSkillTick:
  Skills:
  - effect:particles{p=flame} @Origin
# highlight-start
CoolProjectileSkillHit:
  Skills:
  - damage{a=5}
# highlight-end
```

This makes the projectile deal `5` damage to whatever the projectile hits.

You might be saying, this skill is missing a targeter! However, this is a special case: In an `onHit` skill, the meta-skill automatically targets the hit entity. (Mythic magic)

## Hit this and that

There are a lot of other attributes for projectiles. Let's look at the attributes that denote who the projectile hits.

Let's say that we want the projectile to go through blocks. To do this, we add `stopAtBlock=false` to the projectile.

```yml
CoolProjectileSkill:
  Skills:
  # highlight-start
  - projectile{onTick=CoolProjectileSkillTick;onHit=CoolProjectileSkillHit;stopAtBlock=false} @Target
  # highlight-end
CoolProjectileSkillTick:
  Skills:
  - effect:particles{p=flame} @Origin
CoolProjectileSkillHit:
  Skills:
  - damage{a=5}
```

By default, projectiles only hit players, but we want the projectile to hit all entities. To do that, we add `hitNonPlayers=true` to the projectile.

```yml
CoolProjectileSkill:
  Skills:
  # highlight-start
  - projectile{onTick=CoolProjectileSkillTick;onHit=CoolProjectileSkillHit;stopAtBlock=false;hitNonPlayers=true} @Target
  # highlight-end
CoolProjectileSkillTick:
  Skills:
  - effect:particles{p=flame} @Origin
CoolProjectileSkillHit:
  Skills:
  - damage{a=5}
```

## Movement: velocity and gravity

There are also attributes that change how fast the projectile moves. Firstly, there is a `velocity` attribute that changes the velocity of the projectile.

The velocity formula is this:

$$
\textrm{Blocks per second} = \cfrac{\textrm{velocity attribute on projectile}}{10}
$$

For example, if you set the `velocity` attribute as `50`, it will move 5 blocks per second.

```yml
CoolProjectileSkill:
  Skills:
  # highlight-start
  - projectile{...;velocity=50} @Target
  # highlight-end
CoolProjectileSkillTick:
  Skills:
  - effect:particles{p=flame} @Origin
CoolProjectileSkillHit:
  Skills:
  - damage{a=5}
```
