# Factions and AI

The first concept we will learn with the new Royal Guard is the concept of factions.
In short, factions are a way to group mobs together.

To assign a faction to a mob, we will use the `Faction` field in the mob's configuration:

```yml title="/plugins/MythicMobs/Mobs/RoyalGuard.yml"
RoyalGuard:
  Type: SKELETON
  Display: '&6⚔ &7Royal Guard &6⚔'
  Health: 100
  Damage: 10
  Options:
    MovementSpeed: 0.3
    PreventOtherDrops: true
    PreventSunburn: true
    KnockbackResistance: 1
  Equipment:
  - IRON_SWORD HAND
  - IRON_HELMET HEAD
  - IRON_CHESTPLATE CHEST
  - IRON_LEGGINGS LEGS
  - IRON_BOOTS FEET
  # highlight-start
  Faction: Royal
  # highlight-end
```

Here, we have assigned the `Royal` faction to our Royal Guard mob.
Next, we will go back to our Demonic Mage and assign it the `Demon` faction:

```yml title="/plugins/MythicMobs/Mobs/DemonicMage.yml"
DemonicMage:
  Type: SKELETON
  Display: "&4☠ &7Demonic Mage &4☠"
  Health: 100
  Damage: 10
  Options:
    MovementSpeed: 0.3
    PreventOtherDrops: true
    PreventSunburn: true
    KnockbackResistance: 1
  Equipment:
  - BLAZE_ROD HAND
  - LEATHER_HELMET HEAD
  - LEATHER_CHESTPLATE CHEST
  - LEATHER_LEGGINGS LEGS
  - LEATHER_BOOTS FEET
  Skills:
  - effect:particles{p=flame;hS=0.25;vS=0.5;amount=10} @selfLocation{yoffset=1} ~onTimer:5
  - skill{skill=DemonicMageFireball} ~onTimer:20 0.5
  # highlight-start
  Faction: Demon
  # highlight-end
  Drops:
  - DemonicMageDrops
```

Currently, these factions are just names, but we will soon see how they can be used to create more interesting interactions between mobs.
Next, remember how we wanted the Royal Guard to attack monsters? We can do that through a new concept called Custom AI.

## Custom AI

Normally, mobs just follow the vanilla mob AI, which is basic and inflexible.
Mythic offers a way for us to configure our own AI for mobs, which is much more powerful and versatile.
AI mainly has two components:

- **AI Target Selectors** are used to determine who the mob should target.
- **AI Goal Selectors** are used to determine what the mob should do.

Let's first add an AI Target Selector to our Royal Guard by using the `AITargetSelectors` field:

```yml title="/plugins/MythicMobs/Mobs/RoyalGuard.yml"
RoyalGuard:
  Type: SKELETON
  Display: '&6⚔ &7Royal Guard &6⚔'
  Health: 100
  Damage: 10
  Options:
    MovementSpeed: 0.3
    PreventOtherDrops: true
    PreventSunburn: true
    KnockbackResistance: 1
  Equipment:
  - IRON_SWORD HAND
  - IRON_HELMET HEAD
  - IRON_CHESTPLATE CHEST
  - IRON_LEGGINGS LEGS
  - IRON_BOOTS FEET
  # highlight-start
  AITargetSelectors:
  - clear
  - attacker
  - monsters
  # highlight-end
  Faction: Royal
```

Here, we have added three AI Target Selectors: `clear`, `attacker`, and `monsters`:

- It's always a good idea to start with the `clear` AI Target Selector, which will clear any existing AI Target Selectors which the vanilla AI may have added.
- Next, we added the `attacker` AI Target Selector, which will make the mob attack whoever is attacking it.
- Finally, we added the `monsters` AI Target Selector, which will make the mob attack any monsters it sees.

Notice how we added the `attacker` AI Target Selector before the `otherfactionmonsters` AI Target Selector.
AI Selectors have a **priority** which determines the order in which they are checked.
This means that the mob will prioritize the entity that attacks it over other monsters.

However, the problem now is that the mob will attack any monster it sees, including other Royal Guards.
To fix that, we can use a new AI Target Selector called `otherfactionmonsters` which will make the mob attack any monsters it sees, as long as they are not in the same faction:

```yml
AITargetSelectors:
- clear
- attacker
# highlight-start
- otherfactionmonsters
# highlight-end
```

Done! Now our Royal Guard will attack both attackers and monsters from other factions, even though it is a skeleton.
Next, let's assign some AI Goal Selectors to our Royal Guard by using the `AIGoalSelectors` field:

```yml title="/plugins/MythicMobs/Mobs/RoyalGuard.yml"
RoyalGuard:
  Type: SKELETON
  Display: '&6⚔ &7Royal Guard &6⚔'
  Health: 100
  Damage: 10
  Options:
    MovementSpeed: 0.3
    PreventOtherDrops: true
    PreventSunburn: true
    KnockbackResistance: 1
  Equipment:
  - IRON_SWORD HAND
  - IRON_HELMET HEAD
  - IRON_CHESTPLATE CHEST
  - IRON_LEGGINGS LEGS
  - IRON_BOOTS FEET
  # highlight-start
  AIGoalSelectors:
  - clear
  - meleeattack
  - randomstroll
  # highlight-end
  AITargetSelectors:
  - clear
  - attacker
  - monsters
  Faction: Royal
```

Let's break it down again:

- We added the `clear` AI Goal Selector to clear any existing AI Goal Selectors.
- Next, we added the `meleeattack` AI Goal Selector, which will make the mob use melee attacks against its target.
- Finally, we added the `randomstroll` AI Goal Selector, which will make the mob randomly wander around when it has no target.

With that, we have created a basic AI for our Royal Guard.

Let's do the same for our Demonic Mage:

```yml title="/plugins/MythicMobs/Mobs/DemonicMage.yml"
DemonicMage:
  Type: SKELETON
  Display: "&4☠ &7Demonic Mage &4☠"
  Health: 100
  Damage: 10
  Options:
    MovementSpeed: 0.3
    PreventOtherDrops: true
    PreventSunburn: true
    KnockbackResistance: 1
  Equipment:
  - BLAZE_ROD HAND
  - LEATHER_HELMET HEAD
  - LEATHER_CHESTPLATE CHEST
  - LEATHER_LEGGINGS LEGS
  - LEATHER_BOOTS FEET
  # highlight-start
  AIGoalSelectors:
  - clear
  - meleeattack
  - randomstroll
  AITargetSelectors:
  - clear
  - attacker
  - players
  - villagers
  - golems
  # highlight-end
  Skills:
  - effect:particles{p=flame;hS=0.25;vS=0.5;amount=10} @selfLocation{yoffset=1} ~onTimer:5
  - skill{skill=DemonicMageFireball} ~onTimer:20 0.5
  Faction: Demon
  Drops:
  - DemonicMageDrops
```

Once again, let's break it down:

- The AI Goal selectors are the same as the Royal Guard's.
- The AI Target selectors are different, however. We added the `players`, `villagers`, and `golems` AI Target Selectors, which will make the mob attack players, villagers, and iron golems, respectively.

## Conclusion

Test it out! Spawn a Royal Guard and a Demonic Mage and they should start fighting each other.
Custom AI is a very powerful feature and can be used to create many interesting interactions between mobs.
