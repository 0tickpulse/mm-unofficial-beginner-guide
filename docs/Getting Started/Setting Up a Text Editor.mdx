# Setting Up a Text Editor

:::caution This page is a work in progress

This page is missing a lot of videos/screenshots for now. I will add them soon.

:::

Minecraft Server Development is very configuration-heavy. You will be editing a lot of files and writing code.
Having a good text editor is essential to making your life easier.

:::info Why not just use Notepad/TextEdit?

While you can use Notepad or TextEdit to edit files, they are not designed for editing code.
They lack modern features that make editing code easier, such as syntax highlighting, code-completion, formatting, linting, and more.
Using a text editor designed for code will make your life _much_ easier.

:::

## What is a Text Editor?

A text editor is a program that allows you to edit text files.
Unlike a word processor, a text editor does not add any formatting to your text.
This makes it ideal for editing code and configuration files.

## Choosing and Downloading your Text Editor

There are many text editors available, and everyone has their own preferences.
However, this guide will mainly focus on [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), a free and open-source text editor developed by Microsoft.

Visual Studio Code is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
You can download it from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

If you don't like VSCode, alternatives include [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/).

:::info

I personally use NeoVim but it is not beginner-friendly enough for me to recommend.

### Installing the Extension

:::danger

The extension is very much still in development. It is not recommended to use it for production.
This warning will be removed once the extension is stable. For now, skip this step.

:::

I am working on an extension for Visual Studio Code that will add cool language features for Mythic.
You can install it from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=0tickpulse.vscode-mythic).

## Setting up your Text Editor

### Opening a Folder

When you open Visual Studio Code, you will be greeted with a welcome screen.
Click the "Open Folder" button and select the folder you want to open.
Select your server's folder, and click "Open".

### Using the integrated Terminal

If you followed the preivous page, you should have a terminal open in your server's folder.
However, you no longer need to use that terminal because VSCode has an integrated terminal builtin.
You can open it by clicking "Terminal" in the top menu, and then clicking "New Terminal".

TODO: Video

Now, you can run commands in the terminal just like you would in the command prompt/terminal.

### Learning the Basics

Visual Studio Code has a lot of features, and it can seem a bit overwhelming at first.
We will go through a few of these features that I think are the most useful.

#### The File Explorer

The file explorer is a panel on the left side of the screen that shows all the files in your server's folder.
You can open files by double-clicking them, or by right-clicking them and clicking "Open".
This is a very useful way to navigate your server's files without having to use the file explorer on your computer.

#### Find and Replace

Find and Replace is a very handy feature which allows you to search for text in your file, and optionally replace it with something else.
For example, if you wanted to change all instances of `hello` to `goodbye`, you could use Find and Replace to do that.
You can open Find and Replace by clicking "Edit" in the top menu, and then clicking "Find" to just find files, or "Replace" to find and replace files.
Or, you can use the keyboard shortcuts `Ctrl+F` (⌘F) to find, and `Ctrl+Alt+F` (⌘⌥F) to replace.

TODO: Video

#### The Command Palette

The Command Palette is a very powerful feature that allows you to run commands in Visual Studio Code.
It's extremely useful especially if you can't remember the keyboard shortcut for a command.
You can open the Command Palette by clicking "View" in the top menu, and then clicking "Command Palette".
Or, you can use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+P` (⇧⌘P).

#### Diagnostics

Diagnostics are a feature that allows Visual Studio Code to show you errors and warnings in your code.
For example, if you write invalid YAML, Visual Studio Code will show you an error.
Errors are shown with a red underline, and warnings are shown with a yellow underline.
You can see the error/warning by hovering over the underlined text.

#### Formatting

Formatting is a feature that allows Visual Studio Code to automatically format your code to improve readability.
For example, given the following code:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

```yaml
hello: [a
   b,
        c, d,
                    e]
```

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

If you press `Ctrl+Shift+I` (⇧⌥F) to format, Visual Studio Code will automatically format it to:

```yaml
hello: [a, b, c, d, e]
```

This makes your code much easier to read.

## YAML

YAML is mentioned a few times in this guide so far, so let's take a look at what it is.

In short, YAML is a file format that is used for configuration files.
It's extremely human readable and easy to learn.
Furthermore, if you've used JSON before, you'll find that YAML is very similar to JSON as it is a strict superset of JSON.
We will explore the basic features of YAML in this section.

### Comments

Comments are lines that are ignored by the computer, and are only there for humans to read.
They are very useful for explaining what your code does, or for temporarily disabling code.
In YAML, comments start with a `#` character, and continue until the end of the line.

```yaml
# This is a comment
```

:::tip Handy shortcut

In VSCode, you can quickly add a comment to your code by pressing `Ctrl+/` (⌘/) to toggle a comment on the current line.

:::

### Keys and Values

YAML files are made up of keys and values.
A key is a string that identifies a value.
A value can be anything, including a string, number, list, or even another key-value pair.
Keys and values are separated by a colon (`:`).

```yaml
key: value
```

### Lists

Lists are a type of value that contains multiple values.
You can represent a list by putting each value on a new line, and prefixing it with a `-` character.

```yaml
- value1
- value2
- value3
```

:::info JSON lists

As YAML is a superset of JSON, you can also represent lists in JSON format.

```yaml
key: [value1, value2, value3]
```

:::

### Other Basic Data Types

YAML supports a few basic data types:

-   Strings: A string is a sequence of characters.

    ```yaml
    key: value # This is a string
    ```

-   Numbers: A number is a numeric value.

    ```yaml
    key: 123 # This is a number
    ```

-   Booleans: A boolean is a value that is either `true` or `false`.

    ```yaml
    key: true # This is a boolean
    ```

-   Null: A null value is a value that represents nothing.

    ```yaml
    key: null # This is a null value
    ```

### Indentation

Indentation is very important in YAML as it is used to represent **nested values**, i.e. values that are inside other values.

For instance:

```yaml
prices:
    apple: 1
    orange: 3
```

In this example, `apple` and `orange` are nested inside `prices`.
On the other hand, if we were to write it like this:

```yaml
prices:
apple: 1
orange: 3
```

`apple` and `orange` would not be nested inside `prices`, and would instead be at the same level as `prices`.
As you can see, indents change what your code means, and are therefore very important.
VSCode lets you press `Tab` to indent, and `Shift+Tab` to unindent.

### Basic Example

Here is an example of a YAML file:

```yaml showLineNumbers
my_name: John
my_age: 21
# These are my friends
my_friends:
    - name: Bob
      age: 20
    - name: Alice
      age: 19
```

Test yourself:

<Quiz
    question={
        <>
            What is the value of <code>my_name</code>?
        </>
    }
    answers={["John", "21", "Bob", "Alice"]}
    correctAnswer={0}
    explanation={
        <>
            The value is whatever is after the colon (<code>:</code>). In this case, looking at the line <code>my_name: John</code>, the value is{" "}
            <code>John</code>.
        </>
    }
/>

<Quiz
    question={
        <>
            What data type is <code>my_friends</code>?
        </>
    }
    answers={["String", "List", "Number", "Boolean"]}
    correctAnswer={1}
    explanation={
        <>
            The value is a list, because it is prefixed with a <code>-</code> character.
        </>
    }
/>

<Quiz
    question="Which line contains a comment?"
    answers={["1", "2", "3", "4"]}
    correctAnswer={2}
    explanation={
        <>
            A comment is a line that starts with a <code>#</code> character. In this case, line 3 starts with a <code>#</code> character, so it is a
            comment.
        </>
    }
/>

## Syntax Highlighting

Notice how those code blocks have things that are colored differently?
This is called **Syntax Highlighting** and is one of the many features of a good text editor.
Syntax Highlighting makes it easier to read code by coloring different parts of the code differently.
For instance, you probably found it extremely easy to identify the comments in the code blocks.
To further illustrate this, here is the same code block:

```yaml showLineNumbers
my_name: John
my_age: 21
# These are my friends
my_friends:
    - name: Bob
      age: 20
    - name: Alice
      age: 19
```

And now without any syntax highlighting:

```plaintext showLineNumbers
my_name: John
my_age: 21
# These are my friends
my_friends:
    - name: Bob
      age: 20
    - name: Alice
      age: 19
```

## Quiz

<Quiz
    question="What is the shortcut to find text in a file in VSCode?"
    answers={["Ctrl+Shift+P (⇧⌘P)", "Ctrl+Alt+F (⌘⌥F)", "Ctrl+Shift+I (⇧⌥F)", "Ctrl+F (⌘F)"]}
    correctAnswer={3}
    explanation={
        <>
            The shortcut to find text in a file is <code>Ctrl+F</code> (⌘F). You can remember this by thinking of <code>F</code> as <b>(F)</b>ind.
        </>
    }
/>

<Quiz
    question="How can you represent a comment in YAML?"
    answers={[
        <>
            Starting with a <code>//</code> symbol
        </>,
        <>
            Starting with a <code>#</code> symbol and ending at the end of the line
        </>,
        <>
            Starting with a <code>&lt;!--</code> symbol and ending with a <code>--&gt;</code> symbol
        </>,
        <>
            Starting with a <code>/*</code> symbol and ending with a <code>*/</code> symbol
        </>,
    ]}
    correctAnswer={1}
    explanation={
        <>
            You can represent a comment in YAML by using a <code>#</code> symbol.
        </>
    }
/>

<Quiz
    question="What is the purpose of Syntax Highlighting in an editor?"
    answers={[
        "To make text more visually appealing",
        "To detect and highlight errors within text",
        "To improve code readability by coloring different parts differently",
        "To automatically format the code",
    ]}
    correctAnswer={2}
    explanation={
        <>
            Syntax Highlighting makes it easier to read code by coloring different parts of the code differently. It doesn't actually modify any text,
            so formatting is not within its capabilities.
        </>
    }
