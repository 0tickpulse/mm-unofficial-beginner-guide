# Welcome

Welcome to the **Unofficial Guide to [MythicMobs](https://mythicmobs.net)**! This guide will teach you how to use Mythic, a plugin/series of plugins for Minecraft servers that allows you to create custom mobs, items, and bosses that are beyond your imagination.

## Quick Note: This Guide

This guide is not a comprehensive list of mechanics/conditions etc. Instead, it is a step-by-step guide to understanding Mythic and is to be used in conjunction with the [Official Wiki](https://git.lumine.io/mythiccraft/MythicMobs/-/wikis/Home).

## Where to Start

Note that this guide assumes you know the fundamentals of Minecraft itself and know concepts like mobs, items, blocks, damage, etc. If you don't, you should probably play Minecraft for a bit before trying to make a server.

If you're a total beginner to server development, start with [Background Information](Background%20Information). It will teach you what Mythic is, and what it's capable of. Then, go through the list of pages from up to down in the sidebar on the left.

If you have previous experience in server development, already have a server, and just want to learn about Mythic, skip straight to [Your first mob](Getting%20Started/Your%20First%20Mob).
