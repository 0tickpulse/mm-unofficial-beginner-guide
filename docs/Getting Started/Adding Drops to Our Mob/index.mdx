# Drop Tables

:::caution Placeholder page

This page is a placeholder for the upcoming drop table documentation. It will be updated soon.

:::

We are now going to configure the drops for our mob.
MythicMobs allows us to configure the mob's drops in a very flexible and powerful way.

We will start by adding a `Drops` section to our mob's configuration file.

```yml title="/plugins/MythicMobs/Mobs/DemonicMage.yml"
DemonicMage:
  Type: SKELETON
  Display: "&4☠ &7Demonic Mage &4☠"
  Health: 100
  Damage: 10
  Options:
    MovementSpeed: 0.3
    PreventOtherDrops: true
    PreventSunburn: true
    KnockbackResistance: 1
  Equipment:
  - BLAZE_ROD HAND
  - LEATHER_HELMET HEAD
  - LEATHER_CHESTPLATE CHEST
  - LEATHER_LEGGINGS LEGS
  - LEATHER_BOOTS FEET
  Skills:
  - effect:particles{p=flame;hS=0.25;vS=0.5;amount=10} @selfLocation{yoffset=1} ~onTimer:5
  - skill{skill=DemonicMageFireball} ~onTimer:20 0.5
  # highlight-start
  Drops:
  - ...
  # highlight-end
```

We will add our drops to this section in the form of a YAML list.
Each entry in the list will represent a single drop.

```yml
Drops:
- blaze_powder 3-5 0.5
```

Let's break this down into its components.

* `blaze_powder` is the item that will be dropped.
* `3-5` is the amount of items that will be dropped. This will be a random number between 3 and 5.
* `0.5` is the chance that this drop will occur. This will be a 50% chance.

We can add as many drops as we want to this list.

Here is a generator for a simple drop:

## Drop Tables

The above drop format is very simple, but its capabilities are limited.
To make full use of MythicMobs' drop system, we will need to use drop tables.
