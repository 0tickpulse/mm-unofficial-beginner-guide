# Your First Mob

:::caution Placeholder page

This page is a placeholder. It will be replaced with a proper tutorial soon.

:::info Design Philosophy

The guide follows the philosophy of "learning by doing".
By learning through a real project, you will learn important concepts and will be able to practically apply them.
Therefore, we are going to straight away start with creating a mob.

## The End Product

(this section should talk about what the end product will be, and what the reader will learn)

## Exploring the MythicMobs folder

If you have MythicMobs installed, you should have a folder called `MythicMobs` under your server's `plugins` folder.
This folder contains all the files that MythicMobs uses to run, and should contain a few folders and files, including:

<FileTree
    paths={[
        "config.yml",
        "Mobs/ExampleMobs.yml",
    ]}
    title={<h3>MythicMobs folder</h3>}
/>

The `config.yml` file contains all the settings for MythicMobs, and the `Mobs` folder contains all the mobs that MythicMobs will load.
We are going to create a new file called `TutorialMobs.yml` in the `Mobs` folder, and we will be creating our mob in this file.

So our file tree should now look like this:

<FileTree
    paths={[
        "config.yml",
        "highlight:Mobs/ExampleMobs.yml",
        "Mobs/TutorialMobs.yml",
    ]}
    title={<h3>MythicMobs folder</h3>}
/>

Notice how the files end in `.yml` - this tells us that these files are in the YAML format.

## Creating the mob

We are going to create a mob now!
Open up the `TutorialMobs.yml` file we just made in VSCode
