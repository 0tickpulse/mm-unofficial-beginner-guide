# Common Mistakes

## Don't test in Creative Mode

Many features of MythicMobs, like targeters, ignore creative mode players by default.
This is to prevent mobs from affecting players in creative mode, but it also means that you can't test your mobs in creative mode.
Therefore, you should always check if you are using the correct gamemode when testing your mobs.

## Update your things

MythicMobs is constantly being updated with new features and bug fixes, and so is Paper, Minecraft, and other software.
It is important to keep your server up to date to ensure that you don't run into any issues that have already been fixed.

## Follow proper indentation

MythicMobs uses YAML for configuration, and YAML is very strict about indentation.
If you don't follow the proper indentation, you will get errors.

For example:

```yml
MobID:
# error-start
Type: ZOMBIE
# error-end
```

This will throw an error because the `Type` key is not indented properly.
It should be indented like this:

```yml
MobID:
  Type: ZOMBIE
```
