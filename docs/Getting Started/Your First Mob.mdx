## The End Product

(this section should talk about what the end product will be, and what the reader will learn)

## Exploring the MythicMobs folder

If you have MythicMobs installed, you should have a folder called `MythicMobs` under your server's `plugins` folder.
This folder contains all the files that MythicMobs uses to run, and should contain a few folders and files, including:

<FileTree
    fileTree={[
        { type: "file", name: "config.yml" },
        { type: "folder", name: "Mobs", children: [{ type: "file", name: "ExampleMobs.yml" }] },
    ]}
/>
