# Drop Tables

:::caution Placeholder page

This page is a placeholder for the upcoming drop table documentation. It will be updated soon.

:::

We are now going to configure the drops for our mob.
MythicMobs allows us to configure the mob's drops in a very flexible and powerful way.

We will start by adding a `Drops` section to our mob's configuration file.
